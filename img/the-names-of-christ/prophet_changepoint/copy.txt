Prophets are speaking of Christ at an accelerated rate each conference.
  
  In 2000, there was a 'break' in the trend compared to before, meaning that authors started referring to Christ more than ever before. Speakers continued to break the trend for several years until 2011 when the 'new trend' was set. 
  
  As you can see, prophets continue to speak more and more of Christ. The blue shade represents a 95% probability band, or in other words, we'd expect that, based on past data, there's a 95% chance that authors would speak of Christ, within this range.
  
  So in April 2020, the max expectation was that authors would refer to Christ 2.25% of
the time (top of blue band). In reality, they mentioned Him over 2.5% of every word.
