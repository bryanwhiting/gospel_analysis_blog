## "Read" in the Scriptures

<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<img src="read_files/figure-html5/read-1.png" width="624" />

</div>


The word **read** appears 1,026 times in the scriptures, with 135 appearances in the Book of Mormon. Isn't it interesting that the first chapter
and the last chapter of the Book of Mormon both talk about reading? 1 Nephi tells us about Lehi sharing a vision he had, where he was invited to read a book of scripture by angels. And Moroni 10 tells us to ponder the Book of Mormon and pray to know if it's true.

Here's a verse in the first chapter:

<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

> And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him that he should **read**. (1 Ne. 1:11) 

</div>


And an invitation in the last chapter:



> Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall **read** these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. 
> And when ye shall **receive** these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. (Moroni 10:4-5) 

Consider the power of this: the Book of Mormon is an inspired text. It was received
by revelation by the prophets who wrote it, and those same prophets encourage
us to receive revelation for ourselves. This is so vital, in fact, that
the prophets in the scriptures offer deep warnings about _not_ reading scriptures:

<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">

> Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice. Behold, the scriptures are before you; **if ye will wrest them** it shall be to your own destruction. (Alma 13:20) 

> And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do **wrest** the scriptures and do not understand them. (D&C 10:63) 

</div>


To unbelievers, prophets in the scriptures have often asked, "have ye not read?":

Clearly the Lord gives us scriptures and expects us to read them and understand them. How do we understand them? By the Holy Ghost.

> And by the power of the Holy Ghost ye may know the truth of all things. (Moro. 10:5)

## Modern Prophets Invite Us to Read Daily

Since the dawn of the Restored church, prophets have spoken of the power of
the Book of Mormon, starting with Joseph Smith:

> the Book of mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone 
of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by
any other book. - Joseph Smith, Introduction to the Book of Mormon



The earliest invitation in our 1971-2020 corpus is by Loren C. Dunn in April, 1971:

> I asked them if in the next three months they would resolve to keep themselves morally clean and in harmony with the principles of virtue which the Savior taught. They said they would. And then **I suggested they establish a schedule, on their own, during the next three months to read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover—a few pages each day**, with a prayer at each reading that the Lord would bless them to know if the book is true and actually from him. They agreed.<br>Loren C. Dunn <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1971/04/drink-of-the-pure-water.p39?lang=eng#p39">Drink of the Pure Water</a>, Apr 1971

In 1986, there were 59 references to the Book of Mormon with additional mention of 
words like "read", "study", or "ponder. 5 of these references called to read
the Book of Mormon daily:

The importance of this daily invitation returned in 2017 from President Monson:

Lee counseled, “If we’re not reading the scriptures <strong>daily<\/strong>, our testimonies are growing thinner [and] our spirituality isn’t increasing in depth” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Harold B.

On my to-do list that day, and <strong>every day<\/strong> since, were two items: praying at least morning and evening and reading in the scriptures. Sometimes midnight would come, and I would have to quickly find a private place to pray. Some days my scripture study was brief. I also promised Heavenly Father that I would always try to get to church, even if I missed part of the meeting.

We started attending church, and soon we asked to be baptized. Our father readily gave his permission, but our mother was hesitant, and it took one more month to persuade her to sign the permission slip. On the day of our baptism, she and the rest of our siblings went to church for the first time. She felt the Spirit.

I’ve always enjoyed reading the scriptures and do so on a daily basis individually and with my beloved wife.<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Church <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/04/a-sacred-responsibility.p24?lang=eng#p24\">A Sacred Responsibility<\/a>, Apr 1986","You might start by reading the chapter headnotes to get the feel of the story. The headnote to chapter one in Third Nephi in the book of Mormon reads, in part, “The night of Christ’s birth arrives—The sign is given and a new star arises.” You’re already familiar with that miraculous event, and by reading this chapter you can be comfortably on your way—a first step which can lead to many more each <strong>day<\/strong>.<br>Ardeth G.

If you do so, by the time you reach the mission field, you will have read all four of the standard works. I urge you to read particularly the Book of Mormon so that you can testify of its truthfulness as the Lord has directed.<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Quorum of the Tweleve Apostles <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p9?lang=eng#p9\">Preparing Yourselves for Missionary Service<\/a>, Apr 1985","President Marion G. Romney understood this. Years ago he started a <strong>daily<\/strong> procedure, which he recommended to us, of reading the Book of Mormon each morning for thirty minutes. “I know that it kept me in harmony,” he said, “so far as I did keep in harmony, with the Spirit of the Lord.” Then he added, “It will hold us as close to the Spirit of the Lord as anything I know.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1949, pp. 36, 41.)<br>Ezra Taft Benson, Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1984/10/a-new-witness-for-christ.p26?lang=eng#p26\">A New Witness for Christ<\/a>, Oct 1984","My companions in the priesthood, I love you with all my heart; the General Authorities all love you. We would invite you to spiritually exercise each <strong>day<\/strong>. This you would do at the level of your choosing. For example, read the Book of Mormon a few verses a day, or a chapter a day, fifteen minutes a day, or thirty minutes a day. You will know the amount of spiritual tone that you need to gain. You can accept this challenge, can’t you?<br>J.

I would probably start with the Book of Mormon. I wouldn’t worry if I didn’t understand everything I read the first time—or the second time—or the third. But I’d read often.<br>H.

I know of no better way to do this than by daily reading the Book of Mormon.<br>Marion G. Romney <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1980/04/the-book-of-mormon.p27?lang=eng#p27\">The Book of Mormon<\/a>, Apr 1980","And so, I counsel you, my beloved brothers and sisters and friends everywhere, to make reading the Book of Mormon a few minutes each <strong>day<\/strong> a lifelong practice. All of us need the uninterrupted association with the Spirit of the Lord. We need to take the Holy Spirit for our constant guide that we be not deceived. I am persuaded by my own experience and that of my loved ones, as well as by the statements of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that one can get and keep closer to the Lord by reading the Book of Mormon than by reading any other book. Don’t be content with what someone else tells you about what is in it. Drink deeply from the divine fountain itself.<br>Marion G.

Study them <strong>daily<\/strong>. You may wish to resolve to read particularly the Book of Mormon within the next year. This can be done by averaging less than two pages per <strong>day<\/strong>. If you were to read four pages a day, you could within the next year read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the New Testament. This would be a worthy goal to establish. But please do not settle for less than absorbing the Book of Mormon in the next year of your life.<br>J.

They said they would. And then I suggested they establish a schedule, on their own, during the next three months to read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover—a few pages each <strong>day<\/strong>, with a prayer at each reading that the Lord would bless them to know if the book is true and actually from him.
