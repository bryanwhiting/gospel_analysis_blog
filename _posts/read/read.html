<h2 id="read-in-the-scriptures">“Read” in the Scriptures</h2>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<p><img src="read_files/figure-html5/read-1.png" width="624" /></p>
</div>
<p>The word <strong>read</strong> appears 1,026 times in the scriptures, with 135 appearances in the Book of Mormon. Isn’t it interesting that the first chapter and the last chapter of the Book of Mormon both talk about reading? 1 Nephi tells us about Lehi sharing a vision he had, where he was invited to read a book of scripture by angels. And Moroni 10 tells us to ponder the Book of Mormon and pray to know if it’s true.</p>
<p>Here’s a verse in the first chapter:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<blockquote>
<p>And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him that he should <strong>read</strong>. (1 Ne. 1:11)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>And an invitation in the last chapter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall <strong>read</strong> these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall <strong>receive</strong> these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. (Moroni 10:4-5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider the power of this: the Book of Mormon is an inspired text. It was received by revelation by the prophets who wrote it, and those same prophets encourage us to receive revelation for ourselves. This is so vital, in fact, that the prophets in the scriptures offer deep warnings about <em>not</em> reading scriptures:</p>
<div class="layout-chunk" data-layout="l-body">
<blockquote>
<p>Now I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice. Behold, the scriptures are before you; <strong>if ye will wrest them</strong> it shall be to your own destruction. (Alma 13:20)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do <strong>wrest</strong> the scriptures and do not understand them. (D&amp;C 10:63)</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>To unbelievers, prophets in the scriptures have often asked, “have ye not read?”:</p>

<p>Clearly the Lord gives us scriptures and expects us to read them and understand them. How do we understand them? By the Holy Ghost.</p>

<h2 id="modern-prophets-invite-us-to-read-daily">Modern Prophets Invite Us to Read Daily</h2>
<p>Since the dawn of the Restored church, prophets have spoken of the power of the Book of Mormon, starting with Joseph Smith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the Book of mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book. - Joseph Smith, Introduction to the Book of Mormon</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The earliest invitation in our 1971-2020 corpus is by Loren C. Dunn in April, 1971:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I asked them if in the next three months they would resolve to keep themselves morally clean and in harmony with the principles of virtue which the Savior taught. They said they would. And then <strong>I suggested they establish a schedule, on their own, during the next three months to read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover—a few pages each day</strong>, with a prayer at each reading that the Lord would bless them to know if the book is true and actually from him. They agreed.<br>Loren C. Dunn <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1971/04/drink-of-the-pure-water.p39?lang=eng#p39">Drink of the Pure Water</a>, Apr 1971</p>

<p>In 1986, there were 59 references to the Book of Mormon with additional mention of words like “read”, “study”, or "ponder. 5 of these references called to read the Book of Mormon daily:</p>

We need to read <strong>daily<\/strong> from the pages of the book that will get a man “nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.” (History of the Church, 4:461.)<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Church <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1988/10/flooding-the-earth-with-the-book-of-mormon.p15?lang=eng#p15\">Flooding the Earth with the Book of Mormon<\/a>, Oct 1988","When the family gathers for evening prayer, it is a good time for sharing the <strong>day<\/strong>’s experiences, reading the scriptures, and sharing testimonies. Children especially need to hear the testimonies of their parents. One family repeats one article of faith every evening for a week, or memorizes a scripture, or recites books in the Book of Mormon. Another family focuses on one child or a parent each day with each member telling something good about that person. It takes just a few minutes. Children of all ages need to hear positive observations about themselves—especially from their parents.<br>Michaelene P.

Every <strong>day<\/strong> letters arrive at the President’s office which testify to the enrichment of lives which comes from reading the Book of Mormon. They tell of families united, goals attained, and souls saved. Such is the power of a prophet.<br>Thomas S.

Learning the precepts found in what the Prophet Joseph Smith called the most correct book on earth, the Book of Mormon, is but the first step. Abiding by those precepts found in the “keystone” of our religion gets a man nearer to God than through any other book (see History of the Church, 4:461). Can we not see why we should be reading this book <strong>daily<\/strong> and practicing its precepts at all times?<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Church <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1987/10/come-unto-christ.p52?lang=eng#p52\">“Come unto Christ”<\/a>, Oct 1987","Fifth, study the scriptures. They offer one of the best sources we have to keep in touch with the Spirit of the Lord. One of the ways I have gained my sure knowledge that Jesus is the Christ is through my study of the scriptures. President Ezra Taft Benson has called upon members of the Church to make the study of the Book of Mormon a <strong>daily<\/strong> habit and a lifetime pursuit. The Apostle Paul’s advice to Timothy is good counsel for each of us. He wrote: “From a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.<br>M.

He said, “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (History of the Church, 4:461). That is the third reason for studying the book. It helps us draw nearer to God. Is there not something deep in our hearts that longs to draw nearer to God, to be more like Him in our <strong>daily<\/strong> walk, to feel His presence with us constantly? If so, then the Book of Mormon will help us do so more than any other book.<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Church <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/the-book-of-mormon-keystone-of-our-religion.p27?lang=eng#p27\">The Book of Mormon—<\/a>, Oct 1986","Yes, give me a young woman who loves home and family, who reads and ponders the scriptures <strong>daily<\/strong>, who has a burning testimony of the Book of Mormon. Give me a young woman who faithfully attends her church meetings, who is a seminary graduate, who has earned her Young Womanhood Recognition Award and wears it with pride! Give me a young woman who is virtuous and who has maintained her personal purity, who will not settle for less than a temple marriage, and I will give you a young woman who will perform miracles for the Lord now and throughout eternity.<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Church <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/10/to-the-young-women-of-the-church.p66?lang=eng#p66\">To the Young Women of the Church<\/a>, Oct 1986","“If we would avoid adopting the evils of the world, we must pursue a course which will <strong>daily<\/strong> feed our minds with and call them back to the things of the Spirit.

The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to that counsel. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity—the pure love of Christ—will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness.” (Marion G.

I love that book. It is the book that will get a person nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than any other book. (See Book of Mormon, Introduction.) President Romney recommended studying it half an hour each <strong>day<\/strong>. I commend that practice to you. I’ve always enjoyed reading the scriptures and do so on a daily basis individually and with my beloved wife.<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Church <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/04/a-sacred-responsibility.p24?lang=eng#p24\">A Sacred Responsibility<\/a>, Apr 1986","You might start by reading the chapter headnotes to get the feel of the story. The headnote to chapter one in Third Nephi in the book of Mormon reads, in part, “The night of Christ’s birth arrives—The sign is given and a new star arises.” You’re already familiar with that miraculous event, and by reading this chapter you can be comfortably on your way—a first step which can lead to many more each <strong>day<\/strong>.<br>Ardeth G.

Romney understood this. Years ago he started a <strong>daily<\/strong> procedure, which he recommended to us, of reading the Book of Mormon each morning for thirty minutes. “I know that it kept me in harmony,” he said, “so far as I did keep in harmony, with the Spirit of the Lord.” Then he added, “It will hold us as close to the Spirit of the Lord as anything I know.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1949, pp. 36, 41.)<br>Ezra Taft Benson, Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles <a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1984/10/a-new-witness-for-christ.p26?lang=eng#p26\">A New Witness for Christ<\/a>, Oct 1984","My companions in the priesthood, I love you with all my heart; the General Authorities all love you. We would invite you to spiritually exercise each <strong>day<\/strong>. This you would do at the level of your choosing.

If you were to read four pages a day, you could within the next year read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the New Testament.
