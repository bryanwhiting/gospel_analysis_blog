We study and analyze all text that’s scripture. Like Nephi, our souls “[delight] in proving unto [our] people the truth of the coming of Christ” 2 Nephi 11:4.\nWe focus here on Christian texts often studied by members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, which include scriptures in The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, The New Testament, The Old Testament, The Doctrine and Covenants, and The Pearl of Great Price as well as General Conference Talks. Other scriptures, such as the Apocrypha, could be of interest, but are out of scope for this project.\nDisclaimer\nThis site is not affiliate with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
