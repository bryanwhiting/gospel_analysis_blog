Isn’t it interesting that the first chapter and the last chapter of the Book of Mormon both talk about reading? 1 Nephi tells us about Lehi sharing a vision he had, where he was invited to read a book of scripture by angels. And Moroni 10 tells us to ponder the Book of Mormon and pray to know if it’s true.\nHere’s a verse in the first chapter:\n\n\nAnd they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him that he should read. (1 Ne. 1:11)\n\n\nAnd an invitation in the last chapter:\n\nBehold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts. And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall ask with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ, he will manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost. (Moroni 10:4-5)\n\nConsider the power of this: the Book of Mormon is an inspired text. It was received by revelation by the prophets who wrote it, and those same prophets encourage us to receive revelation for ourselves. This is so vital, in fact, that the prophets in the scriptures offer deep warnings about not reading scriptures:\n\n\nNow I need not rehearse the matter; what I have said may suffice. Behold, the scriptures are before you; if ye will wrest them it shall be to your own destruction. (Alma 13:20)\n\n\nAnd this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do wrest the scriptures and do not understand them. (D&C 10:63)\n\n\nTo unbelievers, prophets in the scriptures have often asked, “have ye not read?”:\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"extensions\":[\"Scroller\"],\"caption\":\"<caption style=\\\"caption-side: bottom; text-align: center;\\\">\\n  <div>Source: <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org\\\">ChurchOfJesusChrist.org<\\/a><\\/div>\\n<\\/caption>\",\"data\":[[\"But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he was an hungred, and they that were with him; (Matthew 12:3)\",\"Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?

(Moro. 10:5)\n\n\nModern Prophets Invite Us to Read Daily\nSince the dawn of the Restored church, prophets have spoken of the power of the Book of Mormon, starting with Joseph Smith:\n\nthe Book of mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book. - Joseph Smith, Introduction to the Book of Mormon\n\nThe earliest invitation in our 1971-2020 corpus is by Loren C. Dunn in April, 1971:\n\nI asked them if in the next three months they would resolve to keep themselves morally clean and in harmony with the principles of virtue which the Savior taught. They said they would. And then I suggested they establish a schedule, on their own, during the next three months to read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover—a few pages each day, with a prayer at each reading that the Lord would bless them to know if the book is true and actually from him. They agreed.Loren C. Dunn Drink of the Pure Water, Apr 1971\n\nIn 1986, there were 59 references to the Book of Mormon with additional mention of words like “read”, “study”, or \"ponder. 5 of these references called to read the Book of Mormon daily:\n\n\n\nThe importance of this daily invitation returned in 2017 from President Monson:\n\n\n\nEvery Invitation to Read Daily\nConsider reading through this list of all invitations to read the Book of Mormon daily.

When I met him, he had been serving as a branch president for several years, but I learned that he had never read the Book of Mormon because it was not yet available in his native Burmese. When I asked him how he knew that the book was true without having read it, he replied that he had studied the Book of Mormon Stories picture book <strong>every <strong>day<\\/strong><\\/strong> by looking at the illustrations, using a dictionary to translate the English words, and taking careful notes of what he learned. He explained, “Every time I studied, I would pray about what I learned, and I would feel peace and joy, my mind would be clear, and my heart would be soft.

We have climbed mountains and unfurled golden banners—from Brazil to Bountiful—signifying the commitment deep within our hearts to remain virtuous and to always be worthy to enter the temple. We have prayed, read the Book of Mormon, and smiled <strong>every <strong>day<\\/strong><\\/strong>, and together with our mothers, grandmothers, and leaders, we are working on our Personal Progress.

I promised my Heavenly Father that I would change. The next <strong>day<\\/strong> I brought a Book of Mormon to the hospital. On my to-do list that day, and <strong>every day<\\/strong> since, were two items: praying at least morning and evening and reading in the scriptures. Sometimes midnight would come, and I would have to quickly find a private place to pray. Some days my scripture study was brief. I also promised Heavenly Father that I would always try to get to church, even if I missed part of the meeting. Over the course of a few weeks, the zeal returned and the fire of testimony burned fiercely again. I promised to never again fall into the spiritual death trap of being casual about these seemingly small actions and thereby jeopardizing things of an eternal nature, regardless of circumstances.<br>Dale G.

Every <strong>day<\\/strong> after school, we would race home to get to the book first. While the first one home was reading, the other one impatiently waited until mealtime, ate in a hurry, and then took her turn reading until bedtime. Such was the excitement we felt. We started attending church, and soon we asked to be baptized. Our father readily gave his permission, but our mother was hesitant, and it took one more month to persuade her to sign the permission slip. On the day of our baptism, she and the rest of our siblings went to church for the first time. She felt the Spirit. After hearing our testimonies, she went to the missionaries and asked them to start teaching her again. A few weeks later, Mother and our younger sister and brothers were baptized. My life changed forever, and the gospel of Jesus Christ became the compelling force in my life.<br>Silvia H.

In accordance with what we have been taught, we read the scriptures as a family <strong>every <strong>day<\\/strong><\\/strong>. We have done so for many years. We have read the Book of Mormon several times in our home, and we will continue to do so.

The Spirit I feel as I <strong>daily<\\/strong> read, ponder, and pray about the Book of Mormon strengthens my understanding and testimony of these things and reaffirms to me that they are true.

After we finished eating, we asked them to leave a spiritual thought with us. They were well prepared and introduced a scripture reading and marking exercise to us. They had brought a fresh copy of the Book of Mormon and a set of colored pencils. We accepted the invitation of the missionaries. Since then, our <strong>daily<\\/strong> Book of Mormon family scripture reading has changed. In every chapter, we mark with different colors the passages related to Jesus Christ as we discover them.

There is a promise of help from God that comes with that <strong>daily<\\/strong> practice. Faithful study of scriptures brings the Holy Ghost to us.

As I bake them, a sweet aroma fills the house. I am able to show my love for my family by sharing something I created. When I study the scriptures, the Spirit of the Lord fills my home. I gain important understanding, which I then share with my family, and my love for them increases. The Lord has told us that our time should “be devoted to the studying of the scriptures” (D&amp;C 26:1) and that “the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given … for [our] instruction” (D&amp;C 33:16). Every woman can be a gospel doctrine instructor in her home, and every sister in the Church needs gospel knowledge as a leader and teacher.

By <strong>daily<\\/strong> study of the Book of Mormon and as I taught the missionary discussions, I experienced the truth the Apostle Paul taught: “Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?” (Rom. 2:21). I learned the plan of happiness by teaching it again and again.<br>Jay E.

It is I will become very well acquainted with the noble prophet Nephi through studying, pondering, and feasting upon the first two books of the Book of Mormon. My young friends, I promise that when you come to really know Nephi, you will be so impressed with his determination, courage, and desire to be obedient to the “things the Lord commands” that you will have a strong desire to incorporate his attributes into your own lives. Then when you are tempted by the adversary, as you may be nearly <strong>every <strong>day<\\/strong><\\/strong>, to deviate from the counsel of the prophets, the wishes of your parents, or what “the Lord commands,” you can immediately have the words of stalwart Nephi automatically come to your mind: “I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded” (1 Ne. 3:7). And when someone with whom you associate suggests you participate in something that is not as “the Lord commands,” you can think of the courageous plea Nephi made to his elder brothers: “Let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord” (1 Ne. 3:16).<br>H.

It has not always been easy for me to study the scriptures. They always seemed too difficult, the terrain too rough. In seminary I was encouraged to form a habit of reading ten minutes <strong>every <strong>day<\\/strong><\\/strong>. I was assured that it would be worth it in the long run. I began my training. Every time I read from the Book of Mormon, I found different messages that related to the problems going on in my life. It was very exciting for me, and tonight I hope you will catch this excitement. I know it’s hard for you. We’ve all been there, but I promise you that if you open up the scriptures and read every single day, this same excitement and testimony will come.

His inspired counsel to the members of the Church, and to all people, has led many to draw close to the scriptures, particularly the Book of Mormon. The testimonies that can be borne to the value of scripture study are numerous. There is a special power in the scriptures.

Learning the precepts found in what the Prophet Joseph Smith called the most correct book on earth, the Book of Mormon, is but the first step. Abiding by those precepts found in the “keystone” of our religion gets a man nearer to God than through any other book (see History of the Church, 4:461).

They offer one of the best sources we have to keep in touch with the Spirit of the Lord. One of the ways I have gained my sure knowledge that Jesus is the Christ is through my study of the scriptures. President Ezra Taft Benson has called upon members of the Church to make the study of the Book of Mormon a <strong>daily<\\/strong> habit and a lifetime pursuit. The Apostle Paul’s advice to Timothy is good counsel for each of us.

He said, “I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book” (History of the Church, 4:461). That is the third reason for studying the book. It helps us draw nearer to God.

I love that book. It is the book that will get a person nearer to God by abiding by its precepts than any other book. (See Book of Mormon, Introduction.) President Romney recommended studying it half an hour each <strong>day<\\/strong>. I commend that practice to you. I’ve always enjoyed reading the scriptures and do so on a daily basis individually and with my beloved wife.<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Church <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1986/04/a-sacred-responsibility.p24?lang=eng#p24\\\">A Sacred Responsibility<\\/a>, Apr 1986\",\"You might start by reading the chapter headnotes to get the feel of the story. The headnote to chapter one in Third Nephi in the book of Mormon reads, in part, “The night of Christ’s birth arrives—The sign is given and a new star arises.” You’re already familiar with that miraculous event, and by reading this chapter you can be comfortably on your way—a first step which can lead to many more each <strong>day<\\/strong>.<br>Ardeth G.

If you do so, by the time you reach the mission field, you will have read all four of the standard works. I urge you to read particularly the Book of Mormon so that you can testify of its truthfulness as the Lord has directed.<br>Ezra Taft Benson, President of the Quorum of the Tweleve Apostles <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1985/04/preparing-yourselves-for-missionary-service.p9?lang=eng#p9\\\">Preparing Yourselves for Missionary Service<\\/a>, Apr 1985\",\"President Marion G. Romney understood this. Years ago he started a <strong>daily<\\/strong> procedure, which he recommended to us, of reading the Book of Mormon each morning for thirty minutes. “I know that it kept me in harmony,” he said, “so far as I did keep in harmony, with the Spirit of the Lord.” Then he added, “It will hold us as close to the Spirit of the Lord as anything I know.” (In Conference Report, Apr. 1949, pp. 36, 41.)<br>Ezra Taft Benson, Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1984/10/a-new-witness-for-christ.p26?lang=eng#p26\\\">A New Witness for Christ<\\/a>, Oct 1984\",\"My companions in the priesthood, I love you with all my heart; the General Authorities all love you. We would invite you to spiritually exercise each <strong>day<\\/strong>. This you would do at the level of your choosing. For example, read the Book of Mormon a few verses a day, or a chapter a day, fifteen minutes a day, or thirty minutes a day. You will know the amount of spiritual tone that you need to gain. You can accept this challenge, can’t you?<br>J.

I would probably start with the Book of Mormon. I wouldn’t worry if I didn’t understand everything I read the first time—or the second time—or the third. But I’d read often.<br>H.

I know of no better way to do this than by daily reading the Book of Mormon.<br>Marion G. Romney <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1980/04/the-book-of-mormon.p27?lang=eng#p27\\\">The Book of Mormon<\\/a>, Apr 1980\",\"And so, I counsel you, my beloved brothers and sisters and friends everywhere, to make reading the Book of Mormon a few minutes each <strong>day<\\/strong> a lifelong practice. All of us need the uninterrupted association with the Spirit of the Lord. We need to take the Holy Spirit for our constant guide that we be not deceived. I am persuaded by my own experience and that of my loved ones, as well as by the statements of the Prophet Joseph Smith, that one can get and keep closer to the Lord by reading the Book of Mormon than by reading any other book. Don’t be content with what someone else tells you about what is in it. Drink deeply from the divine fountain itself.<br>Marion G. Romney <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1980/04/the-book-of-mormon.p57?lang=eng#p57\\\">The Book of Mormon<\\/a>, Apr 1980\",\"Let these scriptures become worn and used so they will feel as comfortable in your hands as well-worn tennis shoes do on your feet. Study them <strong>daily<\\/strong>. You may wish to resolve to read particularly the Book of Mormon within the next year. This can be done by averaging less than two pages per <strong>day<\\/strong>. If you were to read four pages a day, you could within the next year read the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, the Pearl of Great Price, and the New Testament. This would be a worthy goal to establish. But please do not settle for less than absorbing the Book of Mormon in the next year of your life.<br>J.

They said they would. And then I suggested they establish a schedule, on their own, during the next three months to read the Book of Mormon from cover to cover—a few pages each <strong>day<\\/strong>, with a prayer at each reading that the Lord would bless them to know if the book is true and actually from him.

Mormon has more references to Christ than the other Testaments, but the Pearl of Great Price references the Savior the most.\nHow powerful that a whopping 41% of verses in the Book of Mormon refer to Christ! If you read just five verses, two of them are bound to inspire you to think of Him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGeneral Conference References to Christ\nIf we search for these same names of Christ as used in General Conference talks, we see that each year, the leaders of the Church speak of Christ thousands of times.\n\n\n\nFraction of General Conference Words Referring to Christ\nAre prophets speaking more of Christ? Each year, there are a different number of speakers and each talk is of a different length. In the 70’s, General Conference had multiple sessions. If we divide the number of words in a year by the number of references to Christ, we can see that recently about 2.5% of all words spoken in conference are of Christ.\n\n\n\nPercentage of General Conference Paragraphs Referring to Christ\nTo compare these numbers to the Book of Mormon, we computed the fraction of paragraphs in General Conference that speak of Christ. Remember, the Book of Mormon refers to Christ in 41% of its verses. General Conference talks now refer more to Christ per paragraph than the other standard Works (except for the Pearl of Great Price, at 57% of verses.)\n\n\n\nA Shift in the Trend\nProphets are speaking more of Christ than ever before, and at an accelerated rate.\nIn 2000, there was a ‘break’ in the trend compared to before, meaning that authors started referring to Christ more than ever before. Speakers continued to break the trend for several years until 2011 when the ‘new trend’ was set. See footnote for methods. 2\n\n\n\nAs you can see, prophets continue to speak more and more of Christ. The blue shade represents a 95% probability band, or in other words, we’d expect that, based on past data, there’s a 95% chance that authors would speak of Christ, within this range.\nSo in April 2020, the max expectation was that authors would refer to Christ 2.25% of the time (top of blue band). In reality, they mentioned Him over 2.5% of every word.\nTop 20 talks Referring to Christ\nA Dallin H Oak talk in the 70’s spoke of Christ 139 times. Check out the 20 talks that speak the most of Christ.3\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\"],[\"Dallin H.

But where does this phrase come from, and how is it being used today?\nUsage of “Second Coming” in Text\nThe exact phrase “second coming” is only mentioned once in all of the scriptures:\n\n\nTo lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming. (D&C 34:6)\n\n\nYet the phrase is mentioned often in General Conference. It was mentioned a lot in the mid 70’s, but seems to be picking back up again.\n\n\n\nOther Mentions of “Second Coming”\nTurns out that the authors in the Scriptures just referred to the Savior’s Second Coming in a different way. Looking at the Gospel Topics: Second Coming, Topical Guide: Jesus Christ, Second Coming, and the Index to the Triple Combination: Jesus Christ, Second Coming of, there are a few other phrases used to refer to His coming.\n\nThey that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived—verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day….For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver. D&C 45:57-59\n\n\nThe hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes. D&C 49:7.\n\n\nKing of glory shall come… Ps 24:7\n\n\nthey that are Christ’s at his coming… 1 Cor 15:23\n\nIf we use these and phrases to search for His coming, we’d see a lot more references.\nPreparing for His Coming by Hearing Him\nThe Lord teaches us that those who are prepared for His coming “have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide” (D&C 45:57-59) and warns that those “that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for [those] I will not receive at the last day.” (Mosiah 26:28)\nThis phrase “ye not receive” is not exclusive (as if the followers of Christ are better than non-followers) because Christ “inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness” (2 Ne. 26:33). It’s a qualification for baptism, i.e., reception into His church. Individuals need to demonstrate they’ve “are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ” (D&C 20:37), and follow him.\nThe calls to “Hear Him” are abundant in General Conference talks. Here are 20 We can see the 20 most recent references to “Hear Him”:\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"extensions\":[\"Scroller\"],\"caption\":\"<caption style=\\\"caption-side: bottom; text-align: center;\\\">\\n  <div>Source: <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org\\\">ChurchOfJesusChrist.org<\\/a><\\/div>\\n<\\/caption>\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\"],[\"Come, Follow Me is based on that truth.

Our path is uphill most days, but the help we receive for the climb is literally divine. We have three members of the Godhead—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost—helping us because of the covenants we have made.\n\n\nElaine S. Dalton, First Counselor in the Young Women General Presidency Stay on the Path, Apr 2007\n\n\nThe phrase gained momentum in 2013-2017 but took off in October 2018.\n\n\n\nThen Elder Russel M. Nelson mentioned the phrase in a 2015 talk:\n\n\nToday, let me add that we need women who know how to make important things happen by their faith and who are courageous defenders of morality and families in a sin-sick world. We need women who are devoted to shepherding God’s children along the covenant path toward exaltation; women who know how to receive personal revelation, who understand the power and peace of the temple endowment; women who know how to call upon the powers of heaven to protect and strengthen children and families; women who teach fearlessly.\n\n\nBy President Russell M. Nelson, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles A Plea to My Sisters, Oct 2015\n\n\nAnd again in 2017:\n\n\nWe also increase the Savior’s power in our lives when we make sacred covenants and keep those covenants with precision. Our covenants bind us to Him and give us godly power. As faithful disciples, we repent and follow Him into the waters of baptism. We walk along the covenant path to receive other essential ordinances.\n\n\nBy President Russell M. Nelson Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives, Apr 2017\n\n\nBut it didn’t really take of until October 2018 when it was mentioned 24 times. What spurned this growth?\nPresident Nelson became prophet January 14, 2018. In his first message to the members of the church on Jan 16, 2018 (recorded in the Ensign, Apr 2018), he mentioned covenant path four times:\n\nNow, to each member of the Church I say, keep on the covenant path. Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere.\n\n\nYour worship in the temple and your service there for your ancestors will bless you with increased personal revelation and peace and will fortify your commitment to stay on the covenant path.\n\n\nNow, if you have stepped off the path, may I invite you with all the hope in my heart to please come back. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there is a place for you in this, the Lord’s Church. You and generations yet unborn will be blessed by your actions now to return to the covenant path.\n\n(The fourth mention was in a section titled “Stay on the Covenant Path”.)\nPerhaps it’s a good time for us all to learn more about the covenant path and how we can stay on it.\n\n\n\n",
