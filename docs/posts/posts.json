    "contents": "\n\n\n\nDisciples of Christ eagerly await His return to the earth, commonly known as the “Second Coming”. But where does this phrase come from, and how is it being used today?\nUsage of “Second Coming” in Text\nThe exact phrase “second coming” is only mentioned once in all of the scriptures:\n\n\nTo lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming. (D&C 34:6)\n\n\nYet the phrase is mentioned often in General Conference. It was mentioned a lot in the mid 70’s, but seems to be picking back up again.\n\n\n\nOther Mentions of “Second Coming”\nTurns out that the authors in the Scriptures just referred to the Savior’s Second Coming in a different way. Looking at the Gospel Topics: Second Coming, Topical Guide: Jesus Christ, Second Coming, and the Index to the Triple Combination: Jesus Christ, Second Coming of, there are a few other phrases used to refer to His coming.\n\nThey that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived—verily I say unto you, they shall not be hewn down and cast into the fire, but shall abide the day….For the Lord shall be in their midst, and his glory shall be upon them, and he will be their king and their lawgiver. D&C 45:57-59\n\n\nThe hour and the day no man knoweth, neither the angels in heaven, nor shall they know until he comes. D&C 49:7.\n\n\nKing of glory shall come… Ps 24:7\n\n\nthey that are Christ’s at his coming… 1 Cor 15:23\n\nIf we use these and phrases to search for His coming, we’d see a lot more references.\nPreparing for His Coming by Hearing Him\nThe Lord teaches us that those who are prepared for His coming “have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide” (D&C 45:57-59) and warns that those “that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for [those] I will not receive at the last day.” (Mosiah 26:28)\nThis phrase “ye not receive” is not exclusive (as if the followers of Christ are better than non-followers) because Christ “inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness” (2 Ne. 26:33). It’s a qualification for baptism, i.e., reception into His church. Individuals need to demonstrate they’ve “are willing to take upon them the name of Jesus Christ” (D&C 20:37), and follow him.\nThe calls to “Hear Him” are abundant in General Conference talks. Here are 20 We can see the 20 most recent references to “Hear Him”:\n\n\n{\"x\":{\"filter\":\"none\",\"extensions\":[\"Scroller\"],\"caption\":\"<caption style=\\\"caption-side: bottom; text-align: center;\\\">\\n  <div>Source: <a href=\\\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org\\\">ChurchOfJesusChrist.org<\\/a><\\/div>\\n<\\/caption>\",\"data\":[[\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",\"5\",\"6\",\"7\",\"8\",\"9\",\"10\",\"11\",\"12\",\"13\",\"14\",\"15\",\"16\",\"17\",\"18\",\"19\",\"20\"],[\"Come, Follow Me is based on that truth.

One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other—This is My Beloved Son. <strong>Hear Him<\\/strong>!” That, brothers and sisters, was a miracle.<br>By Elder Ronald A.

As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we have taken upon us the name of Jesus Christ by covenant. We have faith in His redeeming power and hope in His great and precious promises. We have every reason to rejoice, for our Lord and Savior is keenly aware of our troubles, cares, and sorrows. As Jesus was with His disciples of old, He is in our boat! I testify He has given His life so that you and I will not perish. May we trust Him, obey His commandments, and with faith <strong>hear Him<\\/strong> say, “Peace, be still.” In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<br>By Lisa L.

Spiritually defining moments come as we prayerfully listen to general conference and as we better keep the commandments. And children, these experiences are for you as well.

Our path is uphill most days, but the help we receive for the climb is literally divine. We have three members of the Godhead—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost—helping us because of the covenants we have made.\n\n\nElaine S. Dalton, First Counselor in the Young Women General Presidency Stay on the Path, Apr 2007\n\n\nThe phrase gained momentum in 2013-2017 but took off in October 2018.\n\n\n\nThen Elder Russel M. Nelson mentioned the phrase in a 2015 talk:\n\n\nToday, let me add that we need women who know how to make important things happen by their faith and who are courageous defenders of morality and families in a sin-sick world. We need women who are devoted to shepherding God’s children along the covenant path toward exaltation; women who know how to receive personal revelation, who understand the power and peace of the temple endowment; women who know how to call upon the powers of heaven to protect and strengthen children and families; women who teach fearlessly.\n\n\nBy President Russell M. Nelson, President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles A Plea to My Sisters, Oct 2015\n\n\nAnd again in 2017:\n\n\nWe also increase the Savior’s power in our lives when we make sacred covenants and keep those covenants with precision. Our covenants bind us to Him and give us godly power. As faithful disciples, we repent and follow Him into the waters of baptism. We walk along the covenant path to receive other essential ordinances.\n\n\nBy President Russell M. Nelson Drawing the Power of Jesus Christ into Our Lives, Apr 2017\n\n\nBut it didn’t really take of until October 2018 when it was mentioned 24 times. What spurned this growth?\nPresident Nelson became prophet January 14, 2018. In his first message to the members of the church on Jan 16, 2018 (recorded in the Ensign, Apr 2018), he mentioned covenant path four times:\n\nNow, to each member of the Church I say, keep on the covenant path. Your commitment to follow the Savior by making covenants with Him and then keeping those covenants will open the door to every spiritual blessing and privilege available to men, women, and children everywhere.\n\n\nYour worship in the temple and your service there for your ancestors will bless you with increased personal revelation and peace and will fortify your commitment to stay on the covenant path.\n\n\nNow, if you have stepped off the path, may I invite you with all the hope in my heart to please come back. Whatever your concerns, whatever your challenges, there is a place for you in this, the Lord’s Church. You and generations yet unborn will be blessed by your actions now to return to the covenant path.\n\n(The fourth mention was in a section titled “Stay on the Covenant Path”.)\nPerhaps it’s a good time for us all to learn more about the covenant path and how we can stay on it.\n\n\n\n",
